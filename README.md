# Constrained Concordance Index
Constraiend Concordance Index (CCI) is a performance evaluation metric for speech, image, and multimedia quality models. It is based on measuring the ability of MOS predictors to rank stimuli pairs where MOS difference is statistically significant. Experiments in this repo compare CCI against Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC), Kendall's Tau (KTAU). 
We have used 2 speech quality models (PESQ, VISQOL), 1 image quality model (SSIM) and 4 MOS databases (P23 EXP1, P23 EXP3, TCD-VOIP, JPEG XR) to validate the CCI metric.
